RED
RED is a very simple program querying a website for some basic Pokémon information.  As the program starts it’ll ask you which Pokémon you want to find out information about.  After you’ve entered the right name, it’ll display the Pokémon’s name, id, height and weight.  
This program will:
1.	Queries an external API
2.	Manipulates the data to make it readable to the user
3.	Displays it for the user
4.	Handles basic errors 

The program was written in Visual Studio and will open straight to if it you double click the RED.pyproj file.
Clicking the RED.py will run the program straight up and allow you to try it without opening Visual Studio.
I installed several libraries in there.  The first one was the requests library, which allowed me to query the external API for the information that I needed.
The Panda library was installed, but I didn't get a chance to use it.

Testing the program:
1. Double click the RED.py file
2. Enter the name of the Pokémon you want to query and press enter
3. After you press enter, it’ll display the information of that Pokémon
4. It’ll then ask you to press Enter to exit the program, and after 3 seconds the program will close 
5. If you type something and then press enter, the program will display a similar message and close after 3 seconds anyway
